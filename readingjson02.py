   Challenge JSON - Converting JSON from an API to pythonic data types.
                    
                    The API we will be reading from is:
                    https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/dragons/{{id}}
                    
                    Documentation for the SpaceX API is available at:
                    https://docs.spacexdata.com/v3"""
